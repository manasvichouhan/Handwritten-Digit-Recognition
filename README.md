# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This project implements a robust handwritten digit recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. It features a real-time interactive application where users can draw digits and receive instant predictions.

Features:

1. Achieves ~99% accuracy on the MNIST test set

2. Real-time digit recognition via a graphical user interface (GUI)

3. Robust to diverse handwriting styles

4. Easy-to-use and extendable codebase



Main dependencies:

1. tensorflow / keras

2. numpy

3. matplotlib

4. pygame

5. opencv-python


Usage:
1. Train the Model.
Run the Jupyter notebook to train the CNN and save the model.

2. Run the Real-Time Recognition App
Execute the Python script for the GUI.
Draw a digit in the window and view the predicted result in real time.
